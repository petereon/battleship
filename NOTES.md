### Story telling
A game starts with two players provided with empty boards.  Each board two 10 x 10 grids, top and bottom.  The bottom grid is the current player's grid, while the upper grid is the opponents.  The grids represent the ocean.  The columns are marked 1 - 10, while the rows are marked A - J.  

User Story 1:  
__As a__ current player  
__I want__ start up the game  
__So that__ I can see the 2 boards capturing mine and opponents oceans  

UAT 1.1:  
__GIVEN__ a two players  
__AND__ the interface is a console  
__WHEN__ the game starts  
__THEN__ the 10 x 10 board representing 1st player's ships is printed to the console on bottom-left  
__AND__ the 10 x 10 board representing 2nd player's ships are printed to the console on bottom-right  
__AND__ the 10 x 10 board representing 1st player's shots are printed to the console on top-left  
__AND__ the 10 x 10 board representing 2nd player's shots are printed to the console on top-right
